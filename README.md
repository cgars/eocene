eocene is the Earthdawn Online Character gENErator
-------------

[Earthdawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthdawn) is a fantasy role-playing game, originally produced by FASA in 1993.
The setting of Earthdawn is the same world as [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun)
(i.e. a fictionalized version of Earth),but takes place millennia earlier.

Eocene is an online character generator based on the Play Framework.  Eocene builds on the brilliant
[EDCG](http://www.adrive.com/public/DtWgxW/EDCG_13e.zip) and still uses the datasets compiled therein.

Eocene features character generation using the first edition rules as well as some changes based on our
yearlong experience with the original ruleset. Furthermore the generated character stats can directly be used to simulate
 dice throws. Karma and legend points can be tracked and characters can be shared with other users.
